# Who We are
**We are the Intikam21 Cyber Team, a group dedicated to assisting individuals working in the field of cybersecurity. Our team was established with the purpose of providing support and guidance in this ever-evolving domain.
Currently, we focus on penetration testing (Pentesting) and solving Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, aiming to make progress in these areas. Although the team is not actively operating at the moment, we plan to continue using the team’s name if new members join in the future.**
